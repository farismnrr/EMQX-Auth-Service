feat: Migrate primary data storage from RocksDB to MySQL with Sea-ORM

This commit represents a major architectural shift from RocksDB to a relational MySQL database managed by Sea-ORM.

Key Changes:
- Integrated Sea-ORM and sea-orm-migration into the project workspace.
- Implemented a new 'migration' package for database schema versioning.
- Refactored all repositories from synchronous RocksDB to asynchronous Sea-ORM queries.
- Updated MqttEntity with Sea-ORM macros and removed bincode dependencies.
- Migrated server initialization to establish Sea-ORM connection and run migrations.
- Completely removed legacy RocksDB infrastructure and associated storage logic.
- Purged unused dependencies including rocksdb and bincode.
- Standardized error handling and refactored API handlers/services to be fully async.
- Optimized code quality by resolving clippy lints and running cargo fmt.
- Updated .env configuration to remove deprecated variables.

This change streamlines the architecture and improves development speed.
